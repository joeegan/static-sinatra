  The origin of the reptiles lies about 320-310 million years ago, in the steaming swamps of the late Carboniferous period, when the first reptiles evolved from advanced reptiliomorph labyrinthodonts.[12] The oldest trace of reptiles is a series of footprints from the fossil strata of Nova Scotia, dated to 315 million years ago.[13] The tracks are attributed to Hylonomus, the oldest known reptile in the biological sense of the word.[14] It was a small, lizard-like animal, about 20 to 30 cm (8-12 in) long, with numerous sharp teeth indicating an insectivorous diet.[15] Other examples include Westlothiana (for the moment considered to be more closely related to amphibians than to amniotes)[citation needed] and Paleothyris, both of similar build and presumably similar habit. One of the best known early reptiles is Mesosaurus, a genus from the early Permian that had returned to water, feeding on fish. The earliest reptiles were largely overshadowed by bigger labyrinthodont amphibians such as Cochleosaurus, and remained a small, inconspicuous part of the fauna until after the small ice age at the end of the Carboniferous.
